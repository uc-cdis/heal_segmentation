In this online study, a modification of a behavioral economics measure, the Cocaine Purchase Task, will quantify for the first time how cocaine users respond to fentanyl contamination in cocaine. This study aims to 1) Determine how possible fentanyl adulteration affects cocaine demand, and 2) Determine which individual characteristics moderate the relationship between fentanyl adulteration and cocaine demand. Determining how possible fentanyl adulteration affects cocaine demand can help inform the development of effective harm reduction interventions for people who use cocaine to address the worsening crisis of opioid related deaths."

They experience symptoms such as excessive crying, irritability, rapid breathing, elevated heart rates, tremors, and sometimes seizures. There is no accepted standard treatment for NOWS; infants are treated with pharmacological (opioid administration and gradual weaning) and nonpharmacological measures. Nonpharmacological care such as swaddling, rocking, frequent feedings, and skin contact, are time consuming, placing a substantial burden on hospitals with limited resources. Prapela, Inc. previously developed a hospital bassinette pad that, using stochastic vibrotactile stimulation (SVS) technology, very gently rocks infants with NOWS to reduce irritability and other symptoms without disturbing sleep patterns. This project will conduct an additional clinical study to determine the SVS bassinette pad’s efficacy in reducing breathing and heart rate, its safety, and its acceptability with clinical staff and parents caring for infants with NOWS."

Several reasons contribute to low MOUD use, including lack of insurance; lack of knowledge about the medications, both among patients and providers; stigma associated with MOUD; and social norms. Innovative methods are needed to help increase MOUD use. One such option is peer-led interventions that might increase patients’ interest in MOUD. One existing peer-led intervention is the Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE) online community intervention that has been designed to reduce stigma and increase health behavior change among stigmatized populations, such as people living with HIV. This project will investigate whether and how HOPE can be adapted for people with opioid use disorder.

The G protein-coupled receptor 160 (GPR160) has emerged as a novel target for analgesic development, as GPR160 in the spinal cord may play a role in the transition from acute to chronic pain. Cocaine- and Amphetamine-Regulated transcript peptide (CARTp) was identified as a ligand for GPR160. Blocking endogenous CARTp signaling in the spinal cord attenuates neuropathic pain, whereas intrathecal injection of CARTp evokes painful hypersensitivity in rodents through GPR160-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cyclic AMP response element-binding pathways (CREB). This project will isolate and biochemically characterize GPR160 and establish methods for biochemical characterization of GPR160 interaction with CARTp activator.

Previous studies suggest that TLR4 is critical in mediating the transition from acute to persistent pain. TLR4 as well as other inflammatory receptors localize to lipid raft microdomains on the plasma membrane. We have found that the secreted apoA-I binding protein (AIBP) accelerates cholesterol removal, disrupts lipid rafts, prevents TLR4 dimerization, and inhibits microglia inflammatory responses. We propose that AIBP targets cholesterol removal to lipid rafts harboring activated TLR4. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine whether AIBP targets lipid rafts harboring activated TLR4; 2) test whether AIBP reduces glial activation and neuroinflammation in mouse models of neuropathic pain; and 3) identify the origin and function of endogenous AIBP in the spinal cord."

NaV1.7 is the most abundant tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channel in small diameter myelinated and unmyelinated afferents, where it has been shown to modulate excitability and set the threshold for action potentials. Development of systemic NaV1.7 inhibitors has been complicated by the challenge of achieving selectivity over other NaV isoforms expressed throughout the body.

To study the efficacy of prevention interventions to arrest the progression from risky opioid use, researchers will test the efficacy of a STOP intervention in primary care settings. STOP adopts an early intervention approach, based on a collaborative care model to prevent progression to moderate/severe OUD, and consists of a practice-embedded nurse care manager who provides patient education and supports the primary care provider (PCP) in engaging, monitoring and guiding patients who have risky opioid use; brief advice delivered to patients by their PCP; and phone counseling of patients by behavioral health providers to motivate and support behavior change.

SBI-553 is an orally available, brain penetrant ?-arrestin biased allosteric modulator of NTR1, which shows efficacy in a range of addiction models and circumvents the clinically limiting side effects. While potentially high risk, the activity of SBI-553 has been validated in vitro and in vivo, and the initial safety profiling indicates no issues that would preclude further development. This study will develop SBI-553 as a treatment for opioid use disorder."

First-line treatment consists of opioid medications, but despite only moderate efficacy and unpleasant side effects, rates of opioid prescriptions have quadrupled over the past 15 years, and this has contributed to high rates of misuse, overdose, and mortality. Clearly, alternative, or non-opioid strategies for treating pain are needed. In this context, “opioid-sparing” medications refer to compounds that can be combined with and enhance the analgesic effects of lower-dose opioids without increasing the rewarding properties of either drug. There is preclinical evidence suggesting that cannabidiol (CBD) may have the potential to function as “opioid-sparing” medications, but its ability to alter opioid-mediated analgesia in humans has yet to be determined. This proposal will fill this gap by conducting a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject randomized crossover study of the effects of CBD and morphine co-administration on pain sensitivity and subjective reinforcement on 28 healthy males and females. This is the first known study to investigate the ability of CBD to alter morphine’s analgesic effects in humans.

The recent finding that reducing the signaling through mu-delta opioid heterodimers appears to enhance opioid antinociception and reduce dependence suggests that a blocker of mixed mu-delta receptors (MDOR antagonist) could be effective in reducing dependence by limiting opioid tolerance and preventing opioid withdrawal. This research group has developed a compound with that characteristic, called D24M, which preliminary studies have shown could reduce opioid dependence by enhancing opioid antinociception, reducing opioid tolerance, or directly inhibiting opioid withdrawal.

In this project, the research team propose a human-on-a-chip neuron tri-culture system composed of nociceptive neurons, GABAergic interneurons and glutamatergic dorsal projection neurons (DPN) integrated with a MEMS construct. Using this model, investigators will interrogate pain signaling physiology at three levels, 1) at the site of origin by targeting nociceptive neurons with pain modulating compounds including noxious stimuli and inflammatory mediators, 2) at the inhibitory GABAergic interneuron, and 3) at the ascending spinal level by targeting glutamatergic DPNs. These circuits will be integrated utilizing expertise in patterning neurons as well as integration with BioMEMs devices. This system provides scientists with a better understanding of ascending pain pathway physiology and enable clinicians to consider alternative indications for treating pain at peripheral and spinal levels. "

Sleep disturbances are prevalent, treatable, and increasingly recognized as risk factors for both chronic pain and OUD. Sleep disruption impairs endogenous pain inhibition, linked to analgesic efficacy and rewarding properties of mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists. It is not known, however, whether sleep disturbance causally alters mechanisms that contribute to OUD risk. Sleep continuity disruption (SCD) and/or sleep fragmentation (SF) may alter cerebral MOR availability, and these forms of sleep disruption may increase OUD risk. This study aims to 1) evaluate whether experimental SCD and/or SF alter resting or pain-evoked MOR binding potential (BP) in brain regions associated with pain inhibition; 2) examine whether SCD and/or SF alters the analgesic response; and 3) determine whether MOR BP in brain regions of interest are associated with analgesia and abuse liability."

Very little is known about efficacious interventions for those who do not meet criteria for moderate/severe OUD (i.e., subthreshold OUD). The prevalence of subthreshold OUD in primary care settings is 5 percent to 10 percent, with higher rates (21 percent to 29 percent) among those receiving prescribed opioids. Although they are at high risk of developing moderate/severe OUD and/or dying from an overdose, little or no empirical evidence exists for pragmatic prevention interventions that can be adopted at integrated general medical settings. To study the efficacy of prevention interventions to arrest the progression from risky opioid use, researchers will test the efficacy of a STOP intervention in primary care settings. STOP adopts an early intervention approach, based on a collaborative care model to prevent progression to moderate/severe OUD, and consists of a practice-embedded nurse care manager who provides patient education and supports the primary care provider (PCP) in engaging, monitoring and guiding patients who have risky opioid use; brief advice delivered to patients by their PCP; and phone counseling of patients by behavioral health providers to motivate and support behavior change. Researchers will determine whether STOP reduces risky opioid use and examine the impact of STOP on progression to moderate/severe OUD, overdose risk behavior and overdose events in adults with risky use of illicit or prescription opioids."

Managing pain post-thoracotomy is critical to enable patients to take deep breaths and remove (via coughing) lung secretions that otherwise significantly increase risk of pneumonia and collapsed lung, hospital re-admission and morbidity. The most severe pain associated with thoracotomy is transmitted along the intercostal nerves, but no long-term analgesic or nerve block device exists that can provide safe and effective long-term reduction of pain. A reversible, patient-controlled, non- addictive, intercostal nerve block device would reduce suffering due to thoracotomy, broken ribs and herpes zoster. In this Phase I project, the team will develop a minimally invasive thermal nerve block device that can control nerve conduction by gently warming and cooling a short nerve segment between room temperature and warm water temperature. This novel approach is based on the discovery that warm and cool temperature mechanisms of nerve block are different and additive, enabling moderate-temperature nerve block by cycling neural tissues slightly above and below body temperature. Reversible thermal nerve blocks represent a completely new approach to managing pain.  "

CIPN can result in chemotherapy dose reduction or discontinuation, and can also have long-term effects on the quality of life. Taxanes (like Paclitaxel) may cause structural damage to peripheral nerves, resulting in aberrant somatosensory processing in the peripheral and/or central nervous system. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons as well as neuronal cells in the spinal cord are key sites in which chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity occurs. T-type Ca2+ channels are critical determinants of increased neuronal excitability and neurotransmission accompanying persistent neuropathic pain. Though Cav3.2 has been targeted clinically with small molecule antagonists, no drugs targeting these channels have advanced to phase II human clinical trials. This proposal aims to explore multicomponent reaction products, for the rapid identification of potent and selective T-type Ca2+ channel antagonists.

To address the unmet needs of cLBP patients with high NA, this study will test in a randomized trial whether the combination of AD and EFAR is more effective than each treatment alone at relieving pain, improving function, combating depression, and preventing opioid misuse. This multimodal combination approach of pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy is novel to the field and has the potential to shift current treatment paradigms."

The opioid problem in rural areas is of particular concern, as rural areas have higher overdose rates despite equivalent rates of OUD. This is because rural areas have a scant number of clinics and clinicians who provide medication treatment for OUD. Thus, people living in rural areas must travel long distances to access clinics that may or may not have expertise in providing treatment to patients with OUD. Telemedicine (TM) could efficiently increase capacity for delivery of buprenorphine in rural areas and may increase the number of patients receiving medication treatment and improve treatment retention and outcomes. While the development of medication treatments for opioid use disorder (MOUD) capacity in primary care settings with optimal/comprehensive services is desirable, the current opioid crisis with escalating overdose death rates in rural areas suggests a need to implement an efficient, cost-effective system of MOUD services that can be scaled up quickly. The use of a centralized and Medicare-covered TM vendor utilizing a developed methodology and established organizational infrastructure offers the great potential for a rapid rollout to increase access to MOUD and improve treatment retention in rural areas. This cluster randomized clinical trial with two phases will test expanded treatment access to improve retention on MOUD in highly affected rural areas.

Ligands with high efficacy for specific signaling pathways (or specific patterns of signaling) that mediate beneficial effects, and with minimal activity at pathways that lead to adverse effects, are expected to have improved therapeutic efficacy. We propose to demonstrate that ligand efficacy for specific signaling pathways associated with antinociception can be finely tuned by structural modifications to a ligand.

The opioid problem in rural areas is of particular concern, as rural areas have higher overdose rates despite equivalent rates of OUD. This is because rural areas have a scant number of clinics and clinicians who provide medication treatment for OUD. Thus, people living in rural areas must travel long distances to access clinics that may or may not have expertise in providing treatment to patients with OUD. Telemedicine (TM) could efficiently increase capacity for delivery of buprenorphine in rural areas and may increase the number of patients receiving medication treatment and improve treatment retention and outcomes. While the development of medication treatments for opioid use disorder (MOUD) capacity in primary care settings with optimal/comprehensive services is desirable, the current opioid crisis with escalating overdose death rates in rural areas suggests a need to implement an efficient, cost-effective system of MOUD services that can be scaled up quickly. The use of a centralized and Medicare-covered TM vendor utilizing a developed methodology and established organizational infrastructure offers the great potential for a rapid rollout to increase access to MOUD and improve treatment retention in rural areas. This cluster randomized clinical trial with two phases will test expanded treatment access to improve retention on MOUD in highly affected rural areas.

MP1000 is a potent analgesic in a range of thermal, inflammatory, and neuropathic analgesic assays. It fails to show reward behavior and does not produce respiratory depression at doses 5-fold greater than its analgesic ED50. Chronic administration does not produce physical dependence or withdrawal when challenged with an antagonist. It shows no cross tolerance to morphine and can be co-administered to subjects already on opioids for pain to lower their opioid usage (i.e., opioid sparing), facilitating the eventual discontinuation of the opioid.

In particular, many ion channels are clustered either with the receptors that modulate them, or with other ion channels whose activities are linked. Often the clustering is mediated by scaffolding proteins, such as the AKAP79/150 protein that is a focus of this research. This research will focus on three different channels critical to nervous function. One is the""M-type"" (KCNQ, Kv7) K+ channel that plays fundamental roles in the regulation of excitability in nerve and muscle. It is thought to associate with Gq/11- coupled receptors, protein kinases, calcineurin (CaN), calmodulin (CaM) and phosphoinositides via AKAP79/150. Another channel of focus is TRPV1, a nociceptive channel in sensory neurons that is also thought to be regulated by signaling proteins recruited by AKAP79/150. The third are L-type Ca2+ (CaV1.2) channels that are critical to synaptic plasticity, gene regulation and neuronal firing. This research will probe complexes containing AKAP79/150 and these three channels using""super-resolution"" STORM imaging of primary sensory neurons and heterologously-expressed tissue-culture cells, in which individual complexes can be visualized at 10-20 nm resolution with visible light, breaking the diffraction barrier of physics. The researchers hypothesize that AKAP79/150 brings several of these channels together to enable functional coupling, which the researchers will examine by patch-clamp electrophysiology of the neurons. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) will also be performed under total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) or confocal microscopy, further testing for complexes containing KCNQ, TRPV1 and CaV1.2 channels. Since all three of these channels bind to AKAP79/150, the researchers hypothesize that they co-assemble into complexes in neurons, together with certain G protein-coupled receptors. Furthermore, the researchers hypothesize these complexes to not be static, but rather to be dynamically regulated by other cellular signals, which the researchers will examine using rapid activation of kinases or phosphatases. Several types of mouse colonies of genetically altered AKAP150 knock-out or knock-in mice will be utilized."

The prevalence of subthreshold OUD in primary care settings is 5 percent to 10 percent, with higher rates (21 percent to 29 percent) among those receiving prescribed opioids. Although they are at high risk of developing moderate/severe OUD and/or dying from an overdose, little or no empirical evidence exists for pragmatic prevention interventions that can be adopted at integrated general medical settings. To study the efficacy of prevention interventions to arrest the progression from risky opioid use, researchers will test the efficacy of a STOP intervention in primary care settings. STOP adopts an early intervention approach, based on a collaborative care model to prevent progression to moderate/severe OUD, and consists of a practice-embedded nurse care manager who provides patient education and supports the primary care provider (PCP) in engaging, monitoring and guiding patients who have risky opioid use; brief advice delivered to patients by their PCP; and phone counseling of patients by behavioral health providers to motivate and support behavior change.

Differentiating clinically salient irritability from developmentally normative temperamental variation has proven to be a difficult task. This is made even more challenging during the preschool period, when irritability has hit its normative peak and measuring neurodevelopment is impeded by methodological constraints. This research will (1) identify specific biomarkers underlying preschool vulnerability for psychopathology by examining neural maturation in executive function as a predictor for clinical outcome; and (2) examine how the parenting environment moderates this vulnerability, with the overarching objective of identifying aberrant irritable trajectories as the foundation for future brain-based behavioral intervention.

According to research and theory, enhancing clinician perspective-taking is a promising strategy for improving the care of AA and low SES patients. We have developed an innovative methodology that utilizes computer-simulated patients and environments to assess, understand, and remediate pain treatment disparities. Our approach allows for the intervention to be individually tailored to each trainee, thereby enhancing its impact. It also allows for individual trainees to gain exposure to a greater range of racially and socioeconomically diverse patients than can normally be obtained in traditional training settings. We hypothesize that our perspective-taking intervention will increase trainees’ knowledge of their own biases, enhance trainees’ empathy toward patients, and reduce trainees’ anxiety/threat toward patients, and that these changes will reduce pain treatment disparities."
