The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) dominates physiological responses to emotions and stress, yet its function and how it unfolds over time and in real-world settings remains understudied in the context of OUD. With new wearable technologies, ANS function can be measured through heart rate variability (HRV) and can be recorded continuously via wearable sensors, providing a non-invasive method to examine physiological mechanisms underlying stress and NA in real-world settings and in real-time. The present research will serve as a pilot study to assess 1. The role of autonomic function (indexed by HRV) as a marker of NA and stress in people with OUD 2. Participants’ adherence to wearing sensor devices and response rates to daily questionnaires. To achieve these objectives, we will monitor participants for 14 days and quantify self-reports measures of stress, overall daytime HRV patterns, and the magnitude, frequency, and duration of reduced HRV instances. Our findings can help advance technologies to address the opioid epidemic, and our understanding of physiological markers as objective measures and predictors of NA and stress in OUD."

Several reasons contribute to low MOUD use, including lack of insurance; lack of knowledge about the medications, both among patients and providers; stigma associated with MOUD; and social norms. Innovative methods are needed to help increase MOUD use. One such option is peer-led interventions that might increase patients’ interest in MOUD. One existing peer-led intervention is the Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE) online community intervention that has been designed to reduce stigma and increase health behavior change among stigmatized populations, such as people living with HIV. This project will investigate whether and how HOPE can be adapted for people with opioid use disorder.

This study will evaluate the efficacy of interventions of varying type and intensity to prevent or reduce opioid misuse or opioid use disorder. The research leverages technology that is appealing to youth to facilitate intervention delivery by health coaches. In this study, adolescents and young adults in the emergency department screening positive for opioid use or misuse will be randomly assigned to one of four intervention conditions with outcomes measured at 4, 8, and 12 months. Technology-driven, scalable interventions delivered via health coaches allow for real-time tailoring to the rapidly changing opioid epidemic, with the potential to prevent an increase in opioid misuse among adolescents and young adults.  Black/African American youth are at increased risk for opioid and other substance use, but they often do not participate in research studies. As a result, it is not known how well prevention interventions work with Black/African American people. This supplement will focus on increasing participant diversity and inclusion by recruiting additional Black/African American participants for this ongoing randomized controlled study of technology-driven prevention interventions."

The G protein-coupled receptor 160 (GPR160) has emerged as a novel target for analgesic development, as GPR160 in the spinal cord may play a role in the transition from acute to chronic pain. Cocaine- and Amphetamine-Regulated transcript peptide (CARTp) was identified as a ligand for GPR160. Blocking endogenous CARTp signaling in the spinal cord attenuates neuropathic pain, whereas intrathecal injection of CARTp evokes painful hypersensitivity in rodents through GPR160-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cyclic AMP response element-binding pathways (CREB). This project will isolate and biochemically characterize GPR160 and establish methods for biochemical characterization of GPR160 interaction with CARTp activator.

This study will modify the chemical structure of these compounds to increase their potency and selectivity so that they may be used as pharmacological tools to investigate the role of GPR3 in modulating pain. In addition, this project focuses on identifying new compounds that show promise for development into therapeutics for the treatment of pain."

Individualized/self-stigma among adults with substance abuse has been shown to lead to delayed recovery, increased relapse and reduced treatment-related attendance. Stigma may induce significant burden on patients with OUD and chronic pain and there may be unique characteristics of stigma for this population due to the overlap between medical treatment and substance abuse. Multiple sources of stigma may be imposed including internalized/self-stigma as well as intragroup/peer-to-peer (?horizontal?) stigma whereby peers impose stigma upon each other based on the type and severity of past drug use. Furthermore, stigma could be ?vertical? in that stigma may be enacted by health care providers or by treatment center staff. However, there is notably a lack of research and related assessment tools to measure these multidimensional facets of stigma, particularly in patients with OUD and chronic pain. The investigators will utilize a mixed-methods approach to evaluate internalized/self-stigma, anticipated/expected stigma and enacted stigma using existing standardized surveys, and to describe horizontal and vertical stigma in individuals with OUD and pain at multiple sites. In addition, the investigators will integrate the quantitative and qualitative information to help inform modifications to the psychotherapy component (I-STOP) of the parent award intervention, which would then also target multidimensional stigma in patients with OUD and chronic pain."

Medications for opioid use disorder (OUD; i.e., methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone) are considered the most effective treatment, reducing mortality and increasing abstinence and retention. However, numerous barriers limit the uptake of medications for OUD in tribal communities and within urban treatment settings serving AI/AN individuals. This is a two-phase formative research study to develop and test an implementation intervention for programs to provide medications to treat OUD specifically with AI/AN consumers. The objective of Phase I (12 months) is to develop a culturally centered implementation intervention to integrate medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) into health care/addiction specialty settings. The objective of Phase II (24 months) is to conduct a preliminary test of the implementation intervention at four sites serving AI/AN communities. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods will be used throughout both phases. This study will help with decreasing stigma and increase the utilization of MOUD in health care settings that serve AI/AN populations."

They will use sensitivity analyses to determine the robustness of stimulation patterns to variations in electrode positioning, selectivity of stimulation, and biophysical properties of the dorsal horn neural network. Researchers will demonstrate improvements from these new stimulus patterns by 1) measuring their effects on pain-related behavioral outcomes in a rat model of chronic neuropathic pain and by 2) quantifying the effects of optimized temporal patterns on spinal cord neuron activity. The outcome will be mechanistically derived and validated stimulus patterns that are significantly more efficacious than the phenomenologically derived standard of care patterns; these patterns could be implemented with either a software update or minor hardware modifications to existing SCS products."

The opioid problem in rural areas is of particular concern, as rural areas have higher overdose rates despite equivalent rates of OUD. This is because rural areas have a scant number of clinics and clinicians who provide medication treatment for OUD. Thus, people living in rural areas must travel long distances to access clinics that may or may not have expertise in providing treatment to patients with OUD. Telemedicine (TM) could efficiently increase capacity for delivery of buprenorphine in rural areas and may increase the number of patients receiving medication treatment and improve treatment retention and outcomes. While the development of medication treatments for opioid use disorder (MOUD) capacity in primary care settings with optimal/comprehensive services is desirable, the current opioid crisis with escalating overdose death rates in rural areas suggests a need to implement an efficient, cost-effective system of MOUD services that can be scaled up quickly. The use of a centralized and Medicare-covered TM vendor utilizing a developed methodology and established organizational infrastructure offers the great potential for a rapid rollout to increase access to MOUD and improve treatment retention in rural areas. This cluster randomized clinical trial with two phases will test expanded treatment access to improve retention on MOUD in highly affected rural areas.

The opioid problem in rural areas is of particular concern, as rural areas have higher overdose rates despite equivalent rates of OUD. This is because rural areas have a scant number of clinics and clinicians who provide medication treatment for OUD. Thus, people living in rural areas must travel long distances to access clinics that may or may not have expertise in providing treatment to patients with OUD. Telemedicine (TM) could efficiently increase capacity for delivery of buprenorphine in rural areas and may increase the number of patients receiving medication treatment and improve treatment retention and outcomes. While the development of medication treatments for opioid use disorder (MOUD) capacity in primary care settings with optimal/comprehensive services is desirable, the current opioid crisis with escalating overdose death rates in rural areas suggests a need to implement an efficient, cost-effective system of MOUD services that can be scaled up quickly. The use of a centralized and Medicare-covered TM vendor utilizing a developed methodology and established organizational infrastructure offers the great potential for a rapid rollout to increase access to MOUD and improve treatment retention in rural areas. This cluster randomized clinical trial with two phases will test expanded treatment access to improve retention on MOUD in highly affected rural areas. Phase I will include implementing telemedicine in a limited number of rural sites with varying levels of office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) to inform implementation strategies for the main trial, and Phase II will include evaluate comparative effectiveness between OBOT alone and OBOT + TM at 30 sites."

However, the most common NIBS methods, e.g., transcranial direct current stimulation, have shown limited, if any, efficacy in treating neuropathic pain. It has been postulated that limitations in conventional NIBS techniques’ focality, penetration, and targeting control limit their therapeutic efficacy . Electrosonic Stimulation (ESStim™) is an improved NIBS modality that overcomes the limitations of other technologies by combining independently controlled electromagnetic and ultrasonic fields to focus and boost stimulation currents via tuned electromechanical coupling in neural tissue . This proposal is focused on evaluating whether our noninvasive ESStim system can effectively treat CP in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), both as a lone treatment and in conjunction with physical therapy (PT). Investigators hypothesize ESStim can be provided synergistically with PT, as both can encourage plasticity-dependent changes which could maximally improve a CTS patient’s pain free mobility. In parallel with the CTS treatments, the team will build multivariate linear and generalized linear regression models to predict the CTS patient outcomes related to pain, physical function, and psychosocial assessments as a function of baseline disease characteristics. The computational work will be used to develop an optimized CTS ESStim dosing model. "

It is thus urgent to develop new, affordable strategies for the effective treatment of OUD. Immunopharmacotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment approach against OUD that relies on the induction of drug-specific antibodies to neutralize circulating drug molecules and reduce or cancel their effects. Several groups have attempted to apply this strategy with mixed results, suggesting that novel immunization platforms must be tested to further improve vaccine efficacy against OUD. This project will fabricate novel nanoparticle-based vaccines against OUD that are likely to boost their immunogenicity and lead to a more robust and effective immune response against the target opioid. The broad impact of this project resides in the rational design of nanoparticle-based vaccines that are safe and effective against opioids.

A Web-based and EHR-integrated OUD CDS system to offer expert guidance to primary care providers (PCPs) on the diagnosis and management of OUD was developed and piloted. This project will implement the OUD clinical decision support system in three large diverse health care systems and randomize a minimum of 30 clinics to receive the OUD-CDS intervention or usual care (UC). The project will evaluate the impact of OUD CDS on practice process measures and patient outcomes. The study will also prepare for scalability and dissemination by evaluating facilitators and barriers to implementation, determining the costs of implementation and maintenance and assessing the short-term cost impacts of the OUD-CDS."

However, naloxone has serious liver toxicity and a short half-life, and its complete antagonism results in a withdrawal effect. Nalmefene is an FDA-approved opioid derivative that is an antagonist of the MOR and a weak agonist of the k-opioid receptors (KOR). An immediate release intravenous injectable formulation was approved by the FDA in 1995 for opioid overdose; however, the requirement for intravenous administration has limited its clinical use. This project, in partnership with Avior, aims to develop a fast-onset, rapidly-dissolving, mucoadhesive thin film formulation that carries uniformly distributed nalmefene nanoparticles on the surface of the film. This film, produced using Avior’s proprietary Speedit™ transmucosal drug delivery technology, rapidly delivers nalmefene when the film is placed in contact with the lower lining of the inner lip. This project will generate non-clinical data to support critical human clinical trials to determine if a transmucosal film can be developed with a rapid onset of action that is required for rescue of opioid overdose patients or taken prophylactically to prevent respiratory depression, to assess whether the effective speed of delivery is sufficient to conduct a human clinical trial."

Although they are at high risk of developing moderate/severe OUD and/or dying from an overdose, little or no empirical evidence exists for pragmatic prevention interventions that can be adopted at integrated general medical settings. To study the efficacy of prevention interventions to arrest the progression from risky opioid use, researchers will test the efficacy of a STOP intervention in primary care settings. STOP adopts an early intervention approach, based on a collaborative care model to prevent progression to moderate/severe OUD, and consists of a practice-embedded nurse care manager who provides patient education and supports the primary care provider (PCP) in engaging, monitoring and guiding patients who have risky opioid use; brief advice delivered to patients by their PCP; and phone counseling of patients by behavioral health providers to motivate and support behavior change.

Their Trypsin Activated Abuse Protection (TAAP™) prodrugs are “enzyme-activated” to release clinically effective opioid drugs only when taken orally and exposed to the correct physiologic conditions, such as exposure to trypsin in the small bowel. Their multi-pill abuse resistance (MPAR™) feature involves in situ bioregulation of opioid delivery from the TAAP™ systems, enabling control over oral multi-dose pharmacokinetic profiles. It is envisaged that an R-methadone-TAAP™ prodrug would demonstrate similar reduced addiction liability as with other opioid-TAAP products.

First-line treatment consists of opioid medications, but despite only moderate efficacy and unpleasant side effects, rates of opioid prescriptions have quadrupled over the past 15 years, and this has contributed to high rates of misuse, overdose, and mortality. Clearly, alternative, or non-opioid strategies for treating pain are needed. In this context, “opioid-sparing” medications refer to compounds that can be combined with and enhance the analgesic effects of lower-dose opioids without increasing the rewarding properties of either drug. There is preclinical evidence suggesting that cannabidiol (CBD) may have the potential to function as “opioid-sparing” medications, but its ability to alter opioid-mediated analgesia in humans has yet to be determined. This proposal will fill this gap by conducting a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject randomized crossover study of the effects of CBD and morphine co-administration on pain sensitivity and subjective reinforcement on 28 healthy males and females. This is the first known study to investigate the ability of CBD to alter morphine’s analgesic effects in humans. If successful, the model will have a lasting impact on our ability to develop and test medications that reduce our reliance on chronic use of opioid medications for pain relief."

Many of these people began taking opioids for pain. A critical treatment goal is to reduce the development of opioid dependence either by enhancing opioid analgesia so lower doses can be used or by blocking withdrawal symptoms. Current pharmacological treatments in these two categories, although effective, present serious limitations. The recent finding that reducing the signaling through mu-delta opioid heterodimers appears to enhance opioid antinociception and reduce dependence suggests that a blocker of mixed mu-delta receptors (MDOR antagonist) could be effective in reducing dependence by limiting opioid tolerance and preventing opioid withdrawal. This research group has developed a compound with that characteristic, called D24M, which preliminary studies have shown could reduce opioid dependence by enhancing opioid antinociception, reducing opioid tolerance, or directly inhibiting opioid withdrawal. They propose to extend this research by investigating whether it can reduce chronic pain in an animal model that mimics the clinical situation of pain patients who transition to dependence. If these studies are successful, they could lead to the development of an optimized drug ready for Investigational New Drug (IND) application and enable translational and clinical testing."

The opioid problem in rural areas is of particular concern, as rural areas have higher overdose rates despite equivalent rates of OUD. This is because rural areas have a scant number of clinics and clinicians who provide medication treatment for OUD. Thus, people living in rural areas must travel long distances to access clinics that may or may not have expertise in providing treatment to patients with OUD. Telemedicine (TM) could efficiently increase capacity for delivery of buprenorphine in rural areas and may increase the number of patients receiving medication treatment and improve treatment retention and outcomes. While the development of medication treatments for opioid use disorder (MOUD) capacity in primary care settings with optimal/comprehensive services is desirable, the current opioid crisis with escalating overdose death rates in rural areas suggests a need to implement an efficient, cost-effective system of MOUD services that can be scaled up quickly. The use of a centralized and Medicare-covered TM vendor utilizing a developed methodology and established organizational infrastructure offers the great potential for a rapid rollout to increase access to MOUD and improve treatment retention in rural areas. This cluster randomized clinical trial with two phases will test expanded treatment access to improve retention on MOUD in highly affected rural areas. Phase I will include implementing telemedicine in a limited number of rural sites with varying levels of office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) to inform implementation strategies for the main trial, and Phase II will include evaluate comparative effectiveness between OBOT alone and OBOT + TM at 30 sites."

Very little is known about efficacious interventions for those who do not meet criteria for moderate/severe OUD (i.e., subthreshold OUD). The prevalence of subthreshold OUD in primary care settings is 5 percent to 10 percent, with higher rates (21 percent to 29 percent) among those receiving prescribed opioids. Although they are at high risk of developing moderate/severe OUD and/or dying from an overdose, little or no empirical evidence exists for pragmatic prevention interventions that can be adopted at integrated general medical settings. To study the efficacy of prevention interventions to arrest the progression from risky opioid use, researchers will test the efficacy of a STOP intervention in primary care settings. STOP adopts an early intervention approach, based on a collaborative care model to prevent progression to moderate/severe OUD, and consists of a practice-embedded nurse care manager who provides patient education and supports the primary care provider (PCP) in engaging, monitoring and guiding patients who have risky opioid use; brief advice delivered to patients by their PCP; and phone counseling of patients by behavioral health providers to motivate and support behavior change. Researchers will determine whether STOP reduces risky opioid use and examine the impact of STOP on progression to moderate/severe OUD, overdose risk behavior and overdose events in adults with risky use of illicit or prescription opioids."

Breathing can be restored after OD by naloxone, but its short half-life can require multiple administrations to reverse OD, and OD symptoms may return after initial reversal if illicit opioids are still present after the effects of naloxone have worn off. Additionally, while the standard treatment of OUD with buprenorphine and methadone reduces relapse and mortality, access and adoption are limited by dosage forms, metabolic liabilities, and potential for misuse and diversion. This study seeks to develop chemically novel, potent mu-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonists and low- and mid-efficacy partial agonists. Current lead counts can outcompete opioid overdoses in preclinical models with a longer half-life, a key naloxone liability for treating OD.

Extend Biosciences' D-VITylation platform technology is truly enabling for small peptide-based therapeutics that are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream by renal filtration. The platform harnesses the naturally long half-life of vitamin D and its dedicated binding protein, VDBP. When the vitamin D molecule is conjugated to a biological therapeutic, it dramatically improves the half-life and bioavailability of the drug. Use of the technology should also allow the drug to be self-administered by subcutaneous injection. This would be of significant benefit to patients.

In a subset of this sample (n = 100), the investigators conduct digital phenotyping to examine the utility of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), digital sensing and social media to predict retention, medication adherence and opioid use outcomes in patients receiving buprenorphine for OUD. It is anticipated that this foundational study will inform the feasibility and utility of such assessments that can be successfully embedded into imminent and future CTN and other OUD clinical trials."

The underlying mechanism for functional selectivity is based upon the formation of ligand-specific receptor conformations that are dependent upon ligand structure. Functional selectivity has the potential to revitalize the drug discovery/development process. Ligands with high efficacy for specific signaling pathways (or specific patterns of signaling) that mediate beneficial effects, and with minimal activity at pathways that lead to adverse effects, are expected to have improved therapeutic efficacy. We propose to demonstrate that ligand efficacy for specific signaling pathways associated with antinociception can be finely tuned by structural modifications to a ligand. We propose to use U50,488 and Salvinorin-A (Sal-A) as scaffolds to develop functionally selective analogs that maintain high efficacy for signaling pathways that lead to antinociception and minimize activity toward anti-antinociceptive signaling pathways."

While our understanding of the development of chronic pain has improved, the available therapeutics provide limited relief. We will examine the peripheral immune and inflammatory response. Secondary inflammation in response to SCI is a series of temporally ordered events: an acute, transient upregulation of chemokines, followed by the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages and generation of an inflammatory environment at the lesion site in the spinal cord, but also surrounding primary nociceptors in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). These events precede neuropathic pain development. Previous work indicates that after SCI, macrophage presence in the DRG correlates with neuropathic pain.

EBPs delivered in schools are an efficient way to reach large populations of young people, including those underserved by other settings, and reduce and prevent ATOD use. Yet youth rarely receive EBPs as intended in community settings, including schools. This training and research plan will prepare the investigator to become an independent scholar in the implementation of theories and frameworks to better understand factors related to program delivery—approaches to enhancing ATOD programs for youth in community settings. More specifically, the training will allow him to expand the application of Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to inform approaches to enhancing effective EBP delivery. The proposed training and research plan extends current implementation research to focus applying implementation theories, frameworks and strategies in other community settings (schools) and on economic evaluation of implementation strategies. The results are expected to improve current efforts to deliver EBPs in diverse community settings and aid in applying evidence-based implementation strategies in the school context to ultimately reduce and prevent ATOD use among youth."

To study the efficacy of prevention interventions to arrest the progression from risky opioid use, researchers will test the efficacy of a STOP intervention in primary care settings. STOP adopts an early intervention approach, based on a collaborative care model to prevent progression to moderate/severe OUD, and consists of a practice-embedded nurse care manager who provides patient education and supports the primary care provider (PCP) in engaging, monitoring and guiding patients who have risky opioid use; brief advice delivered to patients by their PCP; and phone counseling of patients by behavioral health providers to motivate and support behavior change.

Up to 80 percent of addicts reported initiating their habit through prescriptions drugs. Decreasing opioid prescriptions would lower opioid exposure, with fewer people receiving the drugs and less drug available for diversion. Study investigators have identified a novel target in the brain, distinct from any of the traditional opioid receptors capable of mediating potent analgesia without the reward behavior and side effects seen with traditional opioids. They targeted this site with a series of arylepoxamides and have identified a clinical candidate (MP1000) and backup compound. MP1000 is a potent analgesic in a range of thermal, inflammatory, and neuropathic analgesic assays. It fails to show reward behavior and does not produce respiratory depression at doses 5-fold greater than its analgesic ED50. Chronic administration does not produce physical dependence or withdrawal when challenged with an antagonist. It shows no cross tolerance to morphine and can be co-administered to subjects already on opioids for pain to lower their opioid usage (i.e., opioid sparing), facilitating the eventual discontinuation of the opioid. If successful, this project could lead to the development of a viable alternative to current opioid-based analgesics with reduced side effects (such as reward and respiratory depression) compared to opioids."

In particular, many ion channels are clustered either with the receptors that modulate them, or with other ion channels whose activities are linked. Often the clustering is mediated by scaffolding proteins, such as the AKAP79/150 protein that is a focus of this research. This research will focus on three different channels critical to nervous function. One is the""M-type"" (KCNQ, Kv7) K+ channel that plays fundamental roles in the regulation of excitability in nerve and muscle. It is thought to associate with Gq/11- coupled receptors, protein kinases, calcineurin (CaN), calmodulin (CaM) and phosphoinositides via AKAP79/150. Another channel of focus is TRPV1, a nociceptive channel in sensory neurons that is also thought to be regulated by signaling proteins recruited by AKAP79/150. The third are L-type Ca2+ (CaV1.2) channels that are critical to synaptic plasticity, gene regulation and neuronal firing. This research will probe complexes containing AKAP79/150 and these three channels using""super-resolution"" STORM imaging of primary sensory neurons and heterologously-expressed tissue-culture cells, in which individual complexes can be visualized at 10-20 nm resolution with visible light, breaking the diffraction barrier of physics.

Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) will also be performed under total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) or confocal microscopy, further testing for complexes containing KCNQ, TRPV1 and CaV1.2 channels. Since all three of these channels bind to AKAP79/150, the researchers hypothesize that they co-assemble into complexes in neurons, together with certain G protein-coupled receptors. Furthermore, the researchers hypothesize these complexes to not be static, but rather to be dynamically regulated by other cellular signals, which the researchers will examine using rapid activation of kinases or phosphatases.

Very little is known about efficacious interventions for those who do not meet criteria for moderate/severe OUD (i.e., subthreshold OUD). The prevalence of subthreshold OUD in primary care settings is 5 percent to 10 percent, with higher rates (21 percent to 29 percent) among those receiving prescribed opioids. Although they are at high risk of developing moderate/severe OUD and/or dying from an overdose, little or no empirical evidence exists for pragmatic prevention interventions that can be adopted at integrated general medical settings. To study the efficacy of prevention interventions to arrest the progression from risky opioid use, researchers will test the efficacy of a STOP intervention in primary care settings. STOP adopts an early intervention approach, based on a collaborative care model to prevent progression to moderate/severe OUD, and consists of a practice-embedded nurse care manager who provides patient education and supports the primary care provider (PCP) in engaging, monitoring and guiding patients who have risky opioid use; brief advice delivered to patients by their PCP; and phone counseling of patients by behavioral health providers to motivate and support behavior change. Researchers will determine whether STOP reduces risky opioid use and examine the impact of STOP on progression to moderate/severe OUD, overdose risk behavior and overdose events in adults with risky use of illicit or prescription opioids."

Three of the most widely implemented nonpharmacological techniques for CLBP management are cognitive therapy (CT), mindfulness meditation (MM), and behavioral activation (BA). However, there is a critical lack of research examining if these techniques work via the mechanisms specified by theory. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ActiGraph technology embedded within a randomized controlled trial, consisting of daily measures of process and outcome, is ideal for testing mechanism models both during treatment and during the critical period following treatment. The current proposal seeks to utilize EMA and ActiGraph to examine if changes in cognitive content, cognitive process, and activity level are mechanisms specific to CT, MM, and BA, respectively, for reducing pain interference. Elucidating the mechanisms of pain coping skills will lead to streamlined CLBP interventions."

The central hypothesis is that PAR2 expression in nociceptors that project to the meninges plays a key role in the pathogenesis of migraine pain. The aims are to: 1) use the established PAR2 development pipeline to design new PAR2 antagonists with improved drug-like properties; 2) use pharmacological tools in a novel mouse migraine model to further understand the potential role of PAR2 in migraine; and 3) use mouse genetics to study the cell type–specific role of PAR2 in migraine pain."

3R01NR015642-04S1,"SEVERE PAIN DURING WOUND CARE PROCEDURES: MODEL AND MECHANISMS","Clinical Research in Pain Management",,NINR,"University of Iowa","GARDNER, SUE E","Iowa City, IA",2018,"Wound care procedures (WCPs), such as dressing changes, cause moderate to severe pain in 74% of patients, nearly half of whom experience severe pain. Mainstay recommendations to prevent pain during WCPs have focused on either administration of preventive and procedural analgesia or use of expensive, non-adherent dressings. However, it is unclear which patients to target for analgesia or expensive dressings, leading to their inappropriate over- or underuse. To achieve the aims of the study, a comprehensive set of wound, patient, and biological factors will be measured concurrently with pain during a dressing change among a sample of 450 inpatients with open wounds. A predictive model will be developed and biological mechanisms will be examined using logistic regression. The proposed study has the potential to make significant contributions because clinicians will be able to target those patients requiring preventive pain control, thereby eliminating the spiraling impact of painful procedures on nociceptor sensitization."

Pain management is complicated for pregnant women with opioid use disorder (OUD), and undermanagement of pain is a strong risk factor for relapse. Contemplative interventions, such as yoga and mindfulness, may reduce risks for relapse for pregnant and parenting women with OUD. This project represents a partnership with New Hampshire stakeholders to develop and pilot evaluation of a trauma-informed yoga and mindfulness relapse prevention intervention (Mindful Moms in Recovery: MMORE). It aims to: 1) identify needs and areas of adaptation of trauma-informed yoga and mindfulness-based relapse prevention protocols through formative work with pregnant and parenting woman; 2) develop an integrated 10-session intervention protocol with iterative feedback from client stakeholders; and 3) evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy trends of MMORE in a pre-post pilot with pregnant women."

We will identify a set of promising intervention targets for reducing or eliminating racial/ethnic pain disparities. We will interview adult survivors of serious physical injury, comprised of roughly equal proportions of African-Americans (AA), Latinos, and non-Latino Whites (NLW), and examine their medical records for information on injury severity and medication use in-hospital. Our aims are to determine whether: 1) AA and Latino physical injury survivors experience more severe pain relative to NLW; 2) AA and Latino injury survivors experience greater pain burden relative to NLW counterparts; 3) differences in pain severity burden are linked to a set of target candidates for interventions; and (4) pain outcomes in at-risk minority groups can be linked to a set of target candidates for group-tailored interventions to reduce pain severity and pain burden."

To determine multifactorial genetic, psychosocial predictors of opioid-related maternal and infant outcomes using rigorous prospective longitudinal design, innovative combinatorial pharmacogenetic approach, fetal MRI, and neonatal brain resting state functional MRI analysis, we hypothesize that a combination of maternal and infant genetic profiles, maternal psychosocial factors, maternal opioid treatment response, fetal and neonatal neurodevelopment, and NAS treatment will affect maternal and childhood outcomes with prenatal opioid exposure. The specific aims are to (1) Identify high-risk genetic profiles and psychosocial factors in pregnant women with opioid use disorder (OUD) and predisposing to poor maternal opioid maintenance treatment outcomes; (2) Determine maternal-infant genetic profiles and maternal opioid treatment factors predicting adverse fetal development, severity of NAS, and neonatal brain function; and (3) Develop predictive models for maternal opioid relapse and poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with in utero opioid exposure."

Identifying the factors that lead to new opioid dependence among opioid naïve patients is a critical opportunity to reduce prescription opioid dependence and unintended diversion. In the United States, the majority of individuals who become opioid dependent receive their first opioid prescription following surgical procedures, yet there are no clinical guidelines to inform appropriate postoperative opioid use. We will examine the patient factors that are associated with postoperative pain and opioid consumption among a cohort of patients undergoing common elective abdominal procedures. We will identify the provider characteristics in postoperative opioid prescribing practices, and design and implement a provider-directed intervention to optimize postoperative opioid prescribing. Findings will inform patients and providers regarding the risk of opioid dependence following surgery, and will establish a patient-centered data infrastructure that yields continuous feedback to providers regarding appropriate opioid prescribing practices."
